		<h2>Me</h2>
			<p>
			Yo! My name is Steve<br />
			I can't believe<br />
			LaunchCode is free<br />
			For people like me<br />
			I have my own degree<br />
			Cost me like 40<br />
			But leave me out on the street<br />
			As far as I can see<br />
			With four mouths to feed<br />
			This is what I need<br />

		<h2>My Family</h2>
			<p>
			I married my sweetie<br />
			Danielle's so lovely<br />
			Our eldest, Shelby<br />
			Is one half past three<br />
			Her sister is a cutie<br />
			We call her Leesie<br />
			We live in KC<br />
			It's been alright to me<br />
			Someday so surely<br />
			We'll up and leave-y<br />
			Michigan is pretty<br />
			But oh so freeze-y!<br />
